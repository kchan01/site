                <b>My name is Kevin Chan.
                    I am currently a third year at the University of California, Berkeley (Go Bears) and I am studying Molecular and Cell Biology.
                    This site is dedicated to all of my travels and the photos I have taken over the past 5 years. </b>

                <b>Over the past 15 years, I have shot on various cameras (ranging from point and shoot to DSLRs), taken the equivalent of 1 terabyte of photos and videos, and visited 21 countries. </b>

                <b>I currently shoot with a Canon 5D MkII and a Canon EOS M.
                    My favorite photography subjects range from portraits, to long exposures, to nature.</b>

                <b>Some other hobbies that I enjoy include swimming (only during warm weather), playing video games, or drawing.
                    On campus I am heavily involved in the service community and am currently the 2019 President of Cal Berkeley Habitat for Humanity.</b>
